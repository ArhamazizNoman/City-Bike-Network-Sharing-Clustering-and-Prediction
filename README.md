# City-Bike-Network-Sharing-Clustering-and-Prediction
How do different clustering algorithms segment the Citi Bike network, and what operational insights can be derived from the spatial structure of these clusters? To investigate this question, we applied two unsupervised learning techniques K-means and DBSCAN to the geographic coordinates of all Citi Bike stations.
